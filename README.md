Appointment Scheduler App
The Appointment Scheduler App is a web-based application built with Django that allows users to easily schedule appointments using an interactive calendar. Users can choose the service they need, select a preferred employee, view available time slots, and receive notifications related to their appointments.

The application is designed with scalability and clarity in mind, using Django’s class-based views, authentication system, permissions, and a clean project structure.
